Toggles the existence of a class on an element. If the class exists it will be removed, if it doesn't it will be added. 

If a `condition` argument is supplied, the truthiness of that condition is what determines whether the class should exist on the element or not. This simplifies common use case of an element needing a class if `condition` is true.
