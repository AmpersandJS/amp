A function to create numbered lists of integers, handy for each and map loops. `start`, if omitted, defaults to `0`; step defaults to `1`. Returns an `Array` of integers from start to stop, incremented (or decremented) by step, exclusive. 

Note that ranges that stop before they start are considered to be zero-length instead of negative â€” if you'd like a negative range, use a negative step.
