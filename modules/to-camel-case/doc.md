Camel cases a string by removing all whitespace and `-` and `_` characters and capitalizing first letter following those. Takes a string like `"hi world"` and returns it as `hiWorld`. If you pass `true` as the second argument, it will also capitalize the first letter (sometimes referred to as Pascal case).

Note that multiple adjacent whitespace or `-` and `_` characters are removed.
