`toSnakeCase` takes in a string and splits out any word blocks. These parts of the string are then lower-cased and joined together with an underscore. You have the option to make your snake case SCREAM, that is, to make `this_string` to look like `THIS_STRING` by passing in `true` to the `scream` parameter.
