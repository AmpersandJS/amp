Returns the index at which the item can be found in the array (also works for `arguments` object). Returns `-1` if value is not present. Unlike native implementations this won't throw an error if passed something other than an array, it'll just return `-1`. You can optionally pass a `fromIndex` as the third argument to start the search there.
